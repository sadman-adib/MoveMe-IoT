<h1 align="center">MoveMe – An Energy-Efficient Smart Bus Transport Management System with Blind-Spot Collision Detection Ability</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>IoT-powered, AI-driven, and solar-powered solution for safe, efficient, and sustainable public transport in developing countries.</strong></p>

---

## Overview
<strong>MoveMe</strong> integrates multiple smart features to improve safety, efficiency, and sustainability in public transport:

- Real-time bus tracking  
- Blind-spot collision detection (YOLOv4-Tiny + Raspberry Pi)  
- Automated bus-stop detection  
- RFID-based passenger counting  
- Smart bus-door control with safety override  
- Solar-powered smart bus stops  

---

## Motivation
Public transport in developing countries faces challenges such as unreliable schedules, congestion, and safety risks. MoveMe solves these by:

- Providing real-time location to passengers  
- Using AI-based blind-spot detection to prevent accidents  
- Reducing carbon footprint via solar power  
- Offering analytics for better transport management

## Code Breakdown
**`raspberry_pi_codes`**
- `object_detection.py` – Runs YOLOv4-Tiny for blind-spot & bus-stop detection, controls alerts, sensors, and smart door motor.  
- `rfid_test.py` – Reads RFID cards, tracks passenger count, sends data via TCP to ESP32 & bus stop servers.  

**`arduino_esp32_codes`**
- `arduino_code_final.ino` – Displays seats, time, and updates on OLED; syncs with ESP32 for bus stop updates.  
- `esp32_code_final.ino` – Receives passenger data from Raspberry Pi, uploads to cloud (PHP/MySQL), and serves local TCP clients.
